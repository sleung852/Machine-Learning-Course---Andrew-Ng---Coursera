# Machine-Learning-Course---Andrew-Ng---Coursera

I took some other courses online in Python but I found them lacking in explaination in the fundamentals. Oppositely, Andrew Ng here is
doing a fantastic job to give a fundamental understanding from basics to more in-depth understanding of Machine Learning. He did a great 
job particularly in explaining practical tips in applying these alogirthms/methodologies for applying ML.
